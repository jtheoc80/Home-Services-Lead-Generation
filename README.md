# Home-Services-Lead-Generation

Creating Leads For Home Service Contractors

## Overview

This repository provides tools and scrapers for generating leads for home service contractors by collecting and processing building permit data from various municipalities.

## Components

### Permit Leads Scraper (`permit_leads/`)

A comprehensive Python scraping pipeline that collects recent building permit data for the Houston, TX area and outputs normalized records in multiple formats (CSV, SQLite, JSONL).

**Key Features:**
- 🏠 **Houston-area Coverage**: Initially supports City of Houston with extensible architecture for additional municipalities
- 🔍 **Smart Filtering**: Automatically identifies and filters residential permits for contractor leads
- 📊 **Multiple Output Formats**: CSV, SQLite database, and JSONL for different use cases
- 🔄 **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate records using permit ID and content hashing
- 🤖 **Polite Scraping**: Respects robots.txt, implements rate limiting, and polite delays
- 🧪 **Sample Data Support**: Test mode with realistic sample data for development
- ⚡ **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface with flexible options

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd permit_leads
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test with sample data
python -m permit_leads --source city_of_houston --sample --days 7

# Real scraping (when endpoints are configured)
python -m permit_leads --source city_of_houston --days 7 --formats csv sqlite
```

**Architecture:**
- `models/permit.py`: Pydantic-based data models with validation
- `scrapers/`: Scraper implementations (Houston City, extensible for others)
- `adapters/storage.py`: Handles CSV append and SQLite upsert operations
- `utils/`: HTTP utilities, normalization helpers, robots.txt checking
- `tests/`: Comprehensive test suite with sample data fixtures

## Data Enrichment

The permit leads system includes comprehensive data enrichment to increase lead value and improve scoring accuracy.

### Enrichment Pipeline

The enrichment pipeline (`permit_leads/enrich.py`) adds the following data to each permit record:

#### Address & Location
- **Address normalization**: Standardizes formatting and abbreviations
- **Geocoding**: Converts addresses to lat/lon coordinates using configurable providers:
  - Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) - Free, no API key required
  - Mapbox - Commercial, requires API token
  - Google Maps - Commercial, requires API key

#### Parcel/Assessor Data
- **ArcGIS FeatureServer integration**: Fetches property data by coordinates
- **Configurable per county**: Each jurisdiction can have custom endpoints
- **Fields mapped**: APN, year built, heated sqft, lot size, land use

#### Trade Classification
- **NLP keyword matching**: Identifies relevant trades from permit descriptions
- **Supported trades**: roofing, kitchen, bath, pool, fence, windows, foundation, solar, hvac, electrical, plumbing
- **Multiple tags**: Records can have multiple trade classifications

#### Project Analysis
- **Owner classification**: Distinguishes between individual vs LLC/corporate owners
- **Budget bands**: Categorizes project values ($0–5k, $5–15k, $15–50k, $50k+)
- **Start prediction**: Estimates project start date based on jurisdiction-specific inspection timelines

### Enhanced Scoring

The enriched scoring algorithm weights multiple factors:

- **Recency (3x weight)**: Newer permits score higher (0-25 points)
- **Trade match (2x weight)**: High-value trades get priority (roofing: 25pts, kitchen: 24pts, bath: 22pts)
- **Project value (2x weight)**: Logarithmic scaling favors substantial projects
- **Parcel age (1x weight)**: Older homes more likely to need work (15+ years)
- **Inspection status (1x weight)**: Ready-to-proceed permits score higher

Final scores are capped at 100 points.

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables (`.env`)
```bash
# Geocoding provider
GEOCODER=nominatim|mapbox|google
MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_token_here
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here

# County parcel endpoints
HARRIS_COUNTY_PARCELS_URL=https://gis-web.hcad.org/server/rest/services/...
```

#### Per-County Configuration (`permit_leads/enrich_config.yaml`)
```yaml
parcels:
  harris_county:
    endpoint: "https://services.arcgis.com/..."
    field_mapping:
      apn: "ACCOUNT_NUM"
      year_built: "YEAR_BUILT"
      heated_sqft: "BUILDING_SQFT"
      lot_size: "LOT_SIZE"
      land_use: "LAND_USE_CODE"
```

### Usage

#### Database Migration
Before using enrichment, update your database schema:
```bash
python -m permit_leads migrate-db --db data/permits/permits.db
```

#### Export Enriched Leads
```bash
# With full enrichment pipeline
python -m permit_leads export-enriched --lookback 14

# Using existing enriched data only
python -m permit_leads export-enriched --lookback 14 --no-enrich

# Migrate database and export in one step
python -m permit_leads export-enriched --lookback 14 --migrate
```

### Legal & Rate Limiting

- **Respect ToS**: Use official APIs only; don't scrape restricted data
- **Rate limits**: Geocoding providers have rate limits; implement delays for bulk processing
- **PII compliance**: Store only publicly available property records
- **Attribution**: Follow API provider attribution requirements

### Data Sources

#### Geocoding Providers
- **Nominatim**: Free, 1 req/sec limit, requires attribution
- **Mapbox**: 100k free requests/month, commercial usage allowed
- **Google Maps**: Pay-per-use, enterprise features available

#### Parcel Data
- **Harris County, TX**: Public GIS services via ArcGIS
- **Montgomery County, TX**: Custom endpoint configuration
- **Extensible**: Add new counties via configuration files

The enrichment pipeline significantly improves lead quality by providing location context, property characteristics, and intelligent trade matching for more targeted contractor outreach.

## GitHub Actions & Automation

This repository includes automated workflows for daily permit scraping:

- **Scheduled Runs**: Automated daily at 6 AM UTC (1 AM CST/2 AM CDT)
- **Manual Runs**: Trigger via GitHub Actions UI with custom parameters
- **Data Storage**: Results committed to repository and available as downloadable artifacts

See [`docs/github-actions-runbook.md`](docs/github-actions-runbook.md) for complete setup instructions, troubleshooting, and workflow details.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy `permit_leads/.env.example` to `permit_leads/.env` and configure as needed:

```bash
cd permit_leads
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Data Sources

Configure scraping targets in `permit_leads/config/sources.yaml`.
