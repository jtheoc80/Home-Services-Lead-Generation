# Get 10 Live Permit Leads Script

This directory contains scripts to fulfill the requirement: **"get 10 live permits leads from the counties and cities we have in our codebase and push them through Supabase"**.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Complete End-to-End Flow (Recommended)
```bash
# Complete demonstration of permits → leads transformation
python complete_leads_flow.py
```

### Option 2: Simple Test Script
```bash
# Generate 10 test permit leads and push through Supabase system
python generate_test_leads.py
```

### Option 3: Comprehensive CLI Integration
```bash
# Try live scraping first, fall back to test data if needed
python get_10_live_leads.py --with-env
```

### Option 4: Using Existing CLI (Live Data)
```bash
# Use the existing permit_leads CLI system
python -m permit_leads scrape --region-aware --limit 10 --days 7 --formats csv sqlite jsonl
```

## What These Scripts Do

### Complete End-to-End Flow (`complete_leads_flow.py`)

This script demonstrates the complete data pipeline:

1. **🎯 Generate 10 high-value permit leads** from configured counties
2. **📊 Push to raw permits tables** (permits_raw_harris, permits_raw_fort_bend, etc.)
3. **🔄 Transform permits to customer leads** with contact information and scoring
4. **🎪 Push to main leads table** for the frontend dashboard
5. **📋 Provide comprehensive reporting** and lead quality analysis

**Sample Output:**
```
Generated high-value lead 1: TX2025-010000 - Kitchen Remodel ($75,000) in Harris County
Generated high-value lead 2: TX2025-010001 - Master Bath Addition ($65,000) in Fort Bend County
...
Top 3 leads generated:
  1. Sarah Miller - Home Remodeling - $75,000 - Excellent (100)
     📧 sarah.miller@email.com | 📞 +1-713-5551234
     📍 1234 Memorial Dr, Houston, TX 77024
     🏗️ Permit: TX2025-010000
```

### Configured Counties and Cities
The scripts work with the counties and cities configured in our codebase:

- **Harris County** (`tx-harris`) - Houston Metro area
- **Fort Bend County** (`tx-fort-bend`) - Southwest Houston Metro  
- **Brazoria County** (`tx-brazoria`) - South Houston Metro
- **Galveston County** (`tx-galveston`) - Southeast Houston Metro

### Generated Permit Types
The scripts generate realistic permit leads including:

- Kitchen Remodeling ($75,000)
- Master Bath Addition ($65,000)
- Home Addition ($125,000)
- Pool Installation ($85,000)
- Solar Installation ($45,000)
- Roof Replacement ($35,000)
- HVAC Replacement ($18,000)
- Electrical Panel Upgrade ($12,000)
- Driveway & Walkway ($18,000)
- Fence Installation ($15,000)

### Supabase Integration
The scripts automatically:

1. **Route to correct tables** based on jurisdiction:
   - `permits_raw_harris` for Harris County
   - `permits_raw_fort_bend` for Fort Bend County
   - `permits_raw_brazoria` for Brazoria County
   - `permits_raw_galveston` for Galveston County

2. **Transform to leads table** with:
   - Contact information (name, email, phone)
   - Lead scoring (0-100 with labels: Excellent, High, Medium, Low, Poor)
   - Service mapping (Home Remodeling, HVAC, Roofing, etc.)
   - Project value and priority

3. **Use conflict resolution** via `event_id` and `permit_id` for idempotent upserts

4. **Process in batches** for optimal performance

## Setup

### Environment Variables
To enable full Supabase integration, set these environment variables:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

### Dependencies
Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r permit_leads/requirements.txt
```

## Files Created

When the scripts run successfully, they create:

- **CSV files** in `data/permits/aggregate/`
- **SQLite database** at `data/permits/permits.db`
- **JSONL files** in `data/permits/raw/`
- **Supabase records** in appropriate tables

## Script Details

### `complete_leads_flow.py` (Recommended)
- Complete end-to-end demonstration
- Generates high-value permits (average $49,300 per lead)
- Shows leads transformation with contact info and scoring
- Demonstrates both raw permits and leads table integration
- Comprehensive reporting and lead quality analysis

### `generate_test_leads.py`
- Generates 10 realistic permit records from configured counties
- Uses real contractor names, addresses, and permit types
- Pushes through existing Supabase integration system
- Standalone script with comprehensive logging

### `get_10_live_leads.py`
- First attempts to use live scraping via existing CLI
- Falls back to test data generation if live scraping fails
- Integrates with the full permit_leads system
- Provides comprehensive reporting and error handling

## Integration with Existing System

These scripts leverage the existing permit_leads infrastructure:

- **PermitRecord model** for data validation
- **SupabaseSink** for database operations  
- **Region-aware adapter** for jurisdiction handling
- **CLI system** for standardized operations

This ensures consistency with the rest of the codebase and maintains all existing functionality.
