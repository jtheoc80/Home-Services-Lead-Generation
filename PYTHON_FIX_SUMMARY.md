# Python Dependency Fix Summary

## Problem
The Railway deployment was failing with a Python dependency version conflict:
```
The current project's Python requirement (3.10.12) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
- scipy requires Python >=3.11, so it will not be satisfied for Python 3.10.12
Because no versions of scikit-learn match >=1.1.0,<1.7.1 || >1.7.1,<2.0.0 and scikit-learn (1.7.1) depends on scipy (>=1.8.0), scikit-learn (>=1.1.0,<2.0.0) requires scipy (>=1.8.0).
```

## Root Cause
- The nixpacks environment was detecting Python 3.10.12 despite configuring python311
- The scikit-learn version constraint `^1.1.0` was too broad and causing dependency resolution conflicts
- The Python version constraint `^3.11` was not explicit enough

## Solution

### 1. Fixed pyproject.toml
- Changed `python = "^3.11"` to `python = ">=3.11,<4.0"` for explicit version constraints
- Updated `scikit-learn = "^1.1.0"` to `scikit-learn = ">=1.5.0,<2.0.0"` to avoid conflicts

### 2. Enhanced nixpacks.toml
- Added explicit `PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"` environment variable
- Enhanced installation commands to ensure Python 3.11 is used consistently
- Added explicit start command for the backend service

### 3. Verified Dependencies
Generated new poetry.lock with resolved versions:
- numpy: 1.26.4
- scipy: 1.16.1
- scikit-learn: 1.7.1
- pandas: 2.3.1

### 4. Added Test Coverage
Created `test_python_dependencies.py` to validate:
- Python version requirements (>=3.11, <4.0)
- Core ML dependency imports
- FastAPI dependency imports
- Poetry configuration consistency

## Testing Results
- ✅ All dependencies resolve and install correctly
- ✅ All imports work without conflicts
- ✅ Existing deployment tests still pass
- ✅ Poetry configuration validated successfully
- ✅ npm build process works correctly

## Files Changed
- `pyproject.toml` - Fixed Python and scikit-learn version constraints
- `nixpacks.toml` - Enhanced Python 3.11 configuration
- `poetry.lock` - New lock file with resolved dependencies
- `test_python_dependencies.py` - New comprehensive dependency validation test
